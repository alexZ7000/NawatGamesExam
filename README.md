All participants had a week to do this project, a very simple project for those who already have knowledge in the area, which was not my case, this project forced me to research a lot about what Unity is, what C# is and how to use them, and on the day of the presentation you had to present your game and explain how it worked. And while the day of the presentation didn't arrive, I started to install all the necessary software and looked for several tutorials to learn how to work with Unity and C#, but... "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong", and that's exactly what happened , my unity crashed 500 times, not counting the other dozens of bugs that appeared to solve, which consumed me A LOT of time, and so I had only 2 days left to do this project, I thought several times about giving up, my mind was already in one process of self-sabotage, but that's where people prove themselves, with that in mind I didn't give up, I did the project, delivered it and I was approved as an Official Member of Nawat Games!
